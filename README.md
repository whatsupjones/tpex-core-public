# TPEX Core (Public)

**Structured finance analytics and contract intelligence architecture.**

TPEX Core is a software and financial-engineering platform for modeling complex contract behavior, exposure dynamics, and decision pathways in structured finance contexts.

## Why TPEX
Traditional analytics tooling under-explains structural interactions across layered instruments. TPEX is designed to model those interactions as an integrated system.

## Platform Focus
- Contract intelligence and lifecycle-aware analytics
- Exposure and scenario modeling across structured positions
- Decision support for underwriting, risk framing, and portfolio strategy
- Architecture designed for operational use, not just research output

## Engineering Approach
TPEX combines domain modeling with software architecture so financial logic is executable, testable, and deployment-ready.

## Collaboration
I work with qualified partners on technical diligence, deployment strategy, and commercialization pathways.

## Public Boundary
This repository is intentionally high-level.

No proprietary model internals, confidential financial logic details, or trade-secret implementation assets are disclosed here.
